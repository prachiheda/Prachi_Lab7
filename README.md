1. Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.

I would fit them within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed, because that way I can add tests incrementally, make the sure the code I wrote was accurate, and save time by automating these tests. 

2. Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? 

No.
